# Coursera
## Interactive Computer Graphics with WebGL, by Edward Angel

This is my repository for all my Coursera work relating to this specific course.

As with anything, I've tried to keep the content and how things are laid out as reasonable as possible from the point of view of the course, not from point of view of web application design. So it might differ from some normal conventions commonly used due to the fact I want it to be accessible for the people interested in the course. 

I initially started in codepen and realized how I didn't like the development environment even though it allowed me to easily host my content. After that I moved it into my own specific repository and started hosting them from my dropbox for this course. The dropbox might or might not be taken down after the course. You could always try viewing the course content and see if you're lucky enough to see them online :smile:

## Weekly assignments

Currently Week 1 and 2 are missing from this repository as I haven't had the time to move them from the codepen to this repository.
